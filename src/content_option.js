    description: `As a MERN stack developer, I worked on a project called E-Resume, which aimed to provide users with an easy way to create and download resumes in just a few minutes.
    The application featured essential functionalities such as user registration and login, which
    were secured with authentication to ensure the privacy of user data. Users could make
    multiple resumes and edit or delete them as per their requirements.
     To make the process even more convenient for users, the application offered demo resumes
    in various fields, making it easier to understand and create resumes based on the user's
    career interests.
     Finally, users could download their resumes in PDF format, making it easier to share their
    resumes with potential employers.
     The project was developed using ReactJs for the frontend, ExpressJs for the backend, and
    MySQL for data management, ensuring a scalable and efficient application that met the
    needs of the users.`,
